# Project 2: 
### Doc folder

The doc directory contains the report or presentation files. It can have subfolders.  
`main.Rmd` (and `main.html`) holds the structure of this project. It contains the master code that calls different functions in `lib` folder, such as `feature.R`, `train.R`, `cross_validation.R`, and `test.R`. It also reports model performance.
