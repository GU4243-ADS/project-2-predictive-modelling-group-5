### Output folder

The output directory contains analysis output, processed datasets, logs, or other processed things.

The output directory stores pet features from our training and testing data, they are saved as `feature_pet_train.RData` and `feature_pet_test.RData`. It also contains the baseline and proposed models we trained in `fit_train_SIFT_norm.RData` and `fit_train.RData`, cross validation error in `err_cv.RData`, and the prediction result in `pred_test.RData`.
