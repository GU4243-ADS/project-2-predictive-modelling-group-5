# Project 2: 
### Output folder

The output directory contains analysis output, processed datasets, logs, or other processed things.

The output directory stores pet features from our training and testing data. Because the file size is too big, `feature_pet_train.RData` is not stored here. Baseline and our chosen models are stored in `fit_train_SIFT_norm.RData` and `fit_train.RData`.
