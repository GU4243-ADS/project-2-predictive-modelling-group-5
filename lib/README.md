# Project 2: 
### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions that are called in `main.Rmd` (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs), such as `feature.R`, `train.R`, `cross_validation.R`, `test.R`. It also saves a few features we explored and tested in the process.

`feature.R` contains SIFT + HOG features, other feature files are features used in file name. Same for train, test files, models used are shown in file names. We also tried Neural Network as our algorithm, process is shown in `cnn.ipynb`.
