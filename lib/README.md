# Project 2: 
### Code lib Folder

The lib directory contains various files with function definitions that are called in `main.Rmd` (but only function definitions - no code that actually runs), such as `feature.R`, `train.R`, `cross_validation.R`, `test.R`. It also saves a few features we explored and tested in the process.
