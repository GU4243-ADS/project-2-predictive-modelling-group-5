# Project 2: Predictive Modelling

### Data folder

The data directory contains data used in the analysis. This is treated as read only; in paricular the R/python files are never allowed to write to the files in here. Depending on the project, these might be csv files, a database, and the directory itself may have subdirectories.  

This folder contains subsets of `train`, `test` images, and SIFT features. Due to data and file upload size by Github, only subsets of these data is shown here. `mini_dataset` was used to test code running. The folder also has image labels stored in `txt` file.
