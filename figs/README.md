# Project 2: 
### Figs folder

The figs directory contains the figures. This directory only contains generated files; that is, one should always be able to delete the contents and regenerate them.

This folder contains figures generated during modeling or pictures used in the project. `cv_results` is from GBM. `dog_cat` is used in overall project `README`.
